# Detection-of-Diabetes-By-Using-Quart-Web-Application

Overview
This project is a web-based application that predicts the risk of diabetes based on user-provided health parameters. It utilizes machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically a Random Forest Classifier model, to generate accurate predictions. The application is built using the Quart web framework, which provides an asynchronous and efficient way to handle user requests and model predictions.
Features

Diabetes Risk Prediction: Users can input their health data (e.g., age, BMI, glucose levels) and receive a real-time prediction of their diabetes risk.
User-Friendly Interface: The web application provides a clean and responsive user interface built with HTML/CSS, allowing for easy data input and result display.
Machine Learning Model: The application uses a pre-trained Random Forest Classifier model to generate the diabetes risk predictions.
Data Preprocessing: The application handles data preprocessing, including encoding categorical features and normalizing numerical inputs.
Asynchronous Processing: The application uses asynchronous processing to handle user requests and model predictions, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
SQLite Database Integration: The application utilizes a SQLite database to cache previous prediction results, improving the overall performance.
Deployment: The application can be deployed locally or on a cloud platform for wider accessibility.

Technical Stack

Backend: Python (ML, Data Processing), Quart (web framework)
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)
Machine Learning: Python (scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas)

How to Implement

Set up the development environment:

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
Create a virtual environment and activate it.
Install the required dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.


Initialize the database:

Run the sql_updater.py script and execute the init or initdb command to set up the SQLite database and load the sample data.


Explore and understand the codebase:

Review the project structure and the purpose of each file.
Familiarize yourself with the machine learning model implementation in ml.py.
Understand the web application logic in quart_app/app.py and quart_app/routes.py, as well as the data processing utilities in utils.py.
Explore the HTML template in templates/index.html to see the user interface.


Customize the application:

Modify the machine learning model in ml.py if you want to experiment with different algorithms or hyperparameters.
Update the data preprocessing functions in utils.py to handle any changes in the input data format.
Enhance the user interface in templates/index.html to improve the overall look and feel of the application.


Test the application:

Run the application using the command python __main__.py.
Test the application by providing different input data and verifying the accuracy of the predictions.
Add unit tests and integration tests to ensure the application's functionality is maintained during development.


Deploy the application:

Choose a deployment platform, such as a local server or a cloud-based service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.).
Configure the required environment and dependencies for the chosen platform.
Deploy the application and ensure it is accessible to users.


Maintain and update the application:

Monitor the application's performance and user feedback.
Update the machine learning model periodically with new data to maintain the accuracy of the predictions.
Keep the application's dependencies up-to-date by regularly checking for package updates.
